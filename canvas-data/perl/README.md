# Canvas Data PERL routines
## hmac_signature.pl
This is a code snippet that will compute the signature needed for the Canvas Data API calls. 

This code is meant for demonstration purposes and you would want to take and incorporate it into your code rather than use it as a standalone package.

## CanvasData.pm
This is a PERL module that adds object oriented access to the Canvas API.

It can be incorporated into your project. I don't know how to put it up on CPAN.
