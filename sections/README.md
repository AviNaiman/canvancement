# Sort Sections
This user script will sort the list of sections alphabetically

This script was inspired by the [Sort by section name anywhere sections are displayed](https://community.canvaslms.com/ideas/6214) feature request in the Canvas Community.

You must have a user script manager loaded to use these.
