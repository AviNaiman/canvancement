On February 20, 2016, Canvas replaced the number of assignments needing graded with a 9+ indicator. When masses of people complained in the community, they indicated we should file a help ticket.

This is a quick script that I hope quickly becomes obsolete. It will replaced the 9+ with the actual number of assignments needing graded.
