Enhancements to the Canvas LMS

Canvancement is a portmanteau of Canvas and Enhancement.

This repository holds code that can be used to enhance the user's experience using the Canvas Learning Management system by Instructure. Canvancements are usually short scripts that add functionality that is not native to Canvas or that cannot be easily accessed by the users.
