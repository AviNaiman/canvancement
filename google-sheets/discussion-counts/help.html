	<h2>Quick Start</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Choose <strong>Configure API Settings</strong> and enter your
			Canvas Instance and your Access Token.
		</li>
		<li>Choose <strong>Specify Course</strong> and put in the Canvas
			Course ID for the course to analyze.
		</li>
		<li>Choose <strong>Refresh All Discussions</strong> to download
			and analyze your data. Note that this routine will erase any existing
			data and do a complete fetch of all of the discussions.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The <strong>Append New Discussions</strong> will fetch discussions
		that are not already in the data table. Use this option if you want to
		run this program multiple times throughout the term and do not want to
		waste time re-downloading exisiting information. Note that if you
		choose this option, then previously counted discussions will not be
		checked for new posts.
	</p>
	<h2>Understanding the Report</h2>
	<p>After counting the posts, you will have a report in the form of
		a pivot table.</p>
	<p>The rows will contain the names of the students and the columns
		will contain the discussion titles. Both will be in alphabetical
		order.</p>
	<p>
		By default, results are shown only for active students. You may use
		the filters in the report dialog on the right hand side to include <em>completed</em>
		students or <em>teacher</em> or <em>ta</em> roles.
	</p>
