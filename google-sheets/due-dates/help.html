    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose <strong>Configure API Settings</strong> and enter your
        Canvas Instance and your Access Token.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose <strong>Specify Course</strong> and put in the Canvas
        Course ID for the course to analyze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose <strong>Load Due Dates</strong> to download all of the
        due dates from Canvas. Note that this will erase any existing data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modify the dates
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose <strong>Save Due Dates</strong> to save your changes to
        Canvas.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If your times aren't correct, it may be a timezone issue. The spreadsheet's timezone settings are found
      under the <strong>File > Spreadsheet Settings</strong> menu item and should be set before you download the due dates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Reformat Dates</strong> menu item will reformat the dates in Canvas form. This is purely asthetic
      and is not necessary before you save the dates back to Canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quizzes are listed twice, once as a quiz and once as an assignment. You only need to change the dates on the quiz and it will automatically
      save them for the assignment.
    </p>
