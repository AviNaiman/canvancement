# Hide Printed URLs
When you print pages from within Canvas, any hyperlinks have their URL added after the link text. This is great for some people, but they get in the way for others who just want to read the document.

These scripts will remove the URL from after the link when printing a document.

## Hide all URLs
This script will inject CSS onto the page to hide the URL for all links.

* Name: [Hide all URLs](hide-all-urls.user.js)
* Type: [user script](../USERSCRIPTS.md)
* Browsers: Firefox, Chrome

## Hide some URLs
This script will print the URL for all links except for those that are inside a class of "hide_url".

* Name: [Hide specific URLs](hide-some-urls.user.js)
* Type: [user script](../USERSCRIPTS.md)
* Browsers: Firefox, Chrome
