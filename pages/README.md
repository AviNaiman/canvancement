## Deselect Front Page
This user script will allow a user to deselect a front page so that none is selected. 

Credit goes to Matthew Libera who posted how to do this in the Canvas Community: [Allow deselection of Front page status](https://community.canvaslms.com/ideas/2154). I just wrote the script to make it accessible to people without using the API.

### Instructions
After installing the script, open your front page. Then click on the admin cog and choose "Deselect Front Page"

* Name: [dselect_front_page.user.js](../raw/master/pages/dselect_front_page.user.js)
* Type: [user script](../USERSCRIPTS.md)
* Browsers: Firefox, Chrome
